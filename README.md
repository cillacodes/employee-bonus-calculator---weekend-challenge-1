#README for weekend challenge #1

**Author: Priscilla Gyamfi**

The goal of the first weekend challenge is to create a form with basic functionality.
I created variables to calculate the monthly salary expenditures. The variable grabs employeeAnnualSalary, divides that total number by 12 and returns a number with two decimal points. Because I used parseFloat, if a character is passed into employeeAnnualSalary that is not a number, parseFloat will return NaN(not a number).

Form parameters:

+From that collects employee data

+Submit button that clears out the form and stores the info

+The information then appended to the DOM

+Calculate combined employee salary and return monthly cost of salaries
